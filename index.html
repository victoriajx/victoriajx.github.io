         Hello! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Jingxin Mao (Victoria). I graduated from Rice University in 2021, with a double major in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Statistics.
         I am currently pursuing a MEng degree at Cornell University, majoring in Operations Research with a Data Analytics concentration and expect to graduate in May 2022. 
         I have solid skillsets in Economics, Statistics, Data Analytics and Financial Analysis. I am analytical, motivated, impactful and collaborative. I am eager for continuous growth and value creation.
