    My name is Jingxin Mao (Victoria). I graduated from Rice University in 2021, with a double major in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Statistics.
    I am currently pursuing a MEng degree at Cornell University, majoring in Operations Research with a Data Analytics concentration and 
    expect to graduate in May 2022. I have solid skillsets in Economics, Statistics, Data Analytics and Financial Analysis. 
    I am analytical, motivated, impactful and collaborative. I am eager for continuous growth and value creation. <br>
  
    In my free time, I like watching movies, reading books and playing guitar. I am also a good badminton player.
